# Genesis

A machine which can help you to create your codes.

## Get Started

### Install

Goto [Release](https://github.com/zacksleo/genesis/releases) then download the bin called genesis. You can use it now.

For example, I put it in the dir called `~/.composer/vendor/bin`, then I can use it anywhere.
